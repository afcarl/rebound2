Two instructive runs are IAS_sept16_single.txt and IAS_sept16.txt. The first one is what the mini simulation is doing when there is just a single external particle. The second is what the mini simulation is doing when there are two particles (same single particle executing the same close encounter though). When, in debug.py, I do a plot of simply what each is doing for the x,y,z,vx,vy,vz, you can see that both have the same trajectories, but in the IAS_sept16.txt case an offset is occurring. Not sure why, but if I can fix the offset, I think Iâ€™m in the clear!
